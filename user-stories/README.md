# 🏡 Airbnb Clone – User Stories Documentation

## 📘 Overview
This document provides detailed **user stories** based on the **use case diagram** created in the previous task.  
Each user story represents a specific interaction between users and the Airbnb Clone backend system, helping developers understand **what users need** and **why**.

The user stories are derived from the main modules of the Airbnb Clone project:
- User Authentication & Management  
- Property Management  
- Booking System  
- Payment System  
- Reviews & Ratings

## 🎯 Objective
To translate **use case diagram interactions** into **actionable user stories** that capture the system’s functional requirements from the user’s perspective.
